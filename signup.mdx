## Sign up flow

GoPasswordless provides a simple, two step signup flow to register a passkey for the user and verify the user's email address.

### Step 1: Begin Registration

The first step is to call the `beginRegistration` function. This function uses WebAuthn to set up a passkey on the user's device and then
registeres that the public key with GoPasswordless. It the returns a token that you will need for the next step.

<Note>
  WebAuthn passkeys are scoped to a top level domain. GoPasswordless verifies
  that the passkey being used for registration matches the domain linked to your
  app and rejects the registration request if it doesn't.
</Note>

```typescript
import { beginRegistration } from '@gopasswordless/sdk';

...

const signupToken = await beginRegistration(
  'YOUR_APP_ID',
  'USER_EMAIL_ADDRESS'
);
```

### Step 2: Complete Registration

If step 1 is successful, the user will receive a verification code via email. Provide an input to collect this code from the user somewhere
and then call the `completeRegistration` function with this verification code and the token from step 1. If the verifcation code is correct
and the signup token is valid, the response will contain an access token that you can use to authenticate the user in your app.

```typescript
import { completeRegistration } from '@gopasswordless/sdk';

...

const { accessToken } = await completeRegistration(
  'YOUR_APP_ID',
  'USER_EMAIL_ADDRESS',
  'VERIFICATION_CODE'
  'SIGNUP_TOKEN',
);
```
