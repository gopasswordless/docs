You can log users in by calling the `login` function with your app ID and the user's email address. This function will
trigger the browser to prompt the user to unlock their passkey and generate a signature. If the signature is valid, the
response will contain an access token that you can use to authenticate the user in your app.

```typescript
import { login } from "@gopasswordless/sdk";

...

const { accessToken } = await login("YOUR_APP_ID", "USER_EMAIL_ADDRESS");
```
